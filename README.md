## Problem Statement

**Manual Test Creation Is Slow**  
Crafting detailed test scenarios by hand consumes significant time.

**Inconsistency and Gaps**  
Human authors often miss edge cases or apply uneven rigor.

**Maintenance Overhead**  
Keeping test documentation up to date across evolving requirements is laborious.
